## Downloads
You can download a complete ready to go ZIP file containing the compiled `assets.bin` and a HTML file showing a example of it working from the [Releases](https://github.com/fergusfergusfergus/eaglerxpreview/releases) tab.

However, if you want compile this for yourself, firstly get your widget.js and get your sprites.png, then make a new file and make the contents of the file: (contents from widget.js)+(4 null bytes `00 00 00 00`)+(contents from sprites.png), then finally compress that file with the `deflate-raw` algorithm, The final, compressed file is your `assets.bin`.

## Configuration
```javascript
window.eaglercraftXPreview = {
	widget: document.getElementById("example"),
	name: "Minecraft Server", // the name of your server, this will be displayed on your widget.
	force: false, // whether to prioritise the server name over the query name.
	addr: "wss://example.com", // the websocket address of your server
	hideAddr: false, // whether to hide the address of the server on the widget
	spritesheet: "example.png", // the link to your spritesheet used for showing icons on the widget
	type: "server" // "server", "relay"
};
```
